Disclaimer/credit-where-its-due: I borrowed from bootstrap cover template and from w3schools staff page example to aid in consstructing the site. 


This is a draft website for either my personal law practice or for my former law firm--have not decided yet.

index.html is the home page.
practiceareas.html shows the practice areas of the confirm
About.html is a quick introduction to the firm.
staff.html shows the firm's staff.
contactus.html has my contact info.

cover.css is from bootstrap4 but I modified accordingly.

style.css and variables.css are my own stylings.
